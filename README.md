# Dart OOP Assignment

This repository contains a technical assignment for demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart. The assignment includes creating a program that:

- Uses classes and inheritance
- Implements an interface
- Overrides an inherited method
- Initializes a class instance with data from a file
- Demonstrates the use of a loop

## Project Structure

- `main.dart`: The main entry point of the program.
- `person.dart`: Defines the `Person` abstract class.
- `employee.dart`: Implements the `Person` interface and includes additional methods.
- `data.txt`: A sample data file used to initialize an `Employee` instance.

## Files

- `main.dart`
- `person.dart`
- `employee.dart`
- `data.txt`

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dart-oop-assignment.git
    cd dart-oop-assignment
    ```

2. **Ensure Dart is Installed:**

    You can download Dart from the [official site](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

3. **Run the Program:**

    ```bash
    dart main.dart
